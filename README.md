# Text_Classification
Text Classification using BERT

# Instructions 
- First of all install all the dependencies but if you are going to run it in google colab than a notebook is present which you can directly run after altering some paths in the config file.
- Use this command for training:
  => python main.py -c configs/main.yaml 
- Then for testing :
  => python main.py -c configs/main.yaml -t "test"
- Remember to change path to training data in main.yaml and path to test data in test.yaml also you can change other things in config file.
